# My Reads Project

This repository contains my implementation of the MyReads app. This is the final assessment project for the Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the [React Nanodegree Program](https://share.udacity.com/x/WKZa6s). MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
