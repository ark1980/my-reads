# My Reads Project

This repository contains my implementation of the MyReads app. This is the final assessment project for the Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the React Nanodegree Program. MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
